# LaserWeb2
Yip its time to start working on its successor already!

This repo will not be production ready anytime soon

Laserweb (https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb) was born out of a need! Last year when I gave up on getting a certain well known open source java based laser cutting software to work and my skills at the time didnt allow me to complete my development inside Chilipeppr - i caved in and did what I could to help myself get going! The result of which astounds even me! In just over three months LaserWeb grew to be a massively successful opensource project!  But its not without its flaws

Thus today I give birth to the LaserWeb2 project!

The idea is that this time round instead of a mess of code dumped together working through pure magic, LaserWeb2 will actually have an architecture!

Eventually then LaserWeb can become a dev version to test out the craziness and the stable features can be brought into LaserWeb2

Let the Dev begin!

(Note readme / wiki here will stay very quiet!   If you are a user, head over to https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb  - if you are a developer, talk to @openhardwarecoza or view the commit log!)
